[![progress-banner](https://backend.codecrafters.io/progress/shell/b02efed5-8cc3-4123-9194-81695633a548)](https://app.codecrafters.io/users/codecrafters-bot?r=2qF)

This project is a Java implementation of a basic POSIX-compliant shell, developed as part of the "Build Your Own Shell" challenge on [CodeCrafters.io](https://app.codecrafters.io/courses/shell/overview).

## Features

*   **Interactive REPL:** A Read-Eval-Print Loop for interactive use.
*   **Built-in Commands:**
    *   `echo`: Prints arguments to the console.
    *   `exit`: Exits the shell.
    *   `pwd`: Prints the current working directory.
    *   `cd`: Changes the current working directory.
    *   `type`: Displays the type of command (built-in or executable).
*   **External Command Execution:** Finds and executes commands from the system's `PATH`.
*   **Quoting and Escaping:**
    *   **Quoted executable names:** Command names can be quoted (e.g., `'my program' arg` or `"exe with spaces" file`)
    *   Single quotes (`'...'`): Preserves literal text including spaces.
    *   Double quotes (`"..."`): Preserves literal text including spaces, with selective backslash escaping.
    *   Escape character (`\`): Escapes the next character outside quotes.
*   **Stdout Redirection:** Redirect command output to files using `>` or `1>` operators.
    *   Automatically creates parent directories if they don't exist.
    *   Overwrites existing files.
    *   Examples: `echo hello > output.txt`, `pwd 1> dir.txt`, `ls > logs/output.txt`
*   **Cross-Platform Support:** Compatible with Unix, Linux, macOS, and Windows.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several packages:

*   `repl`: Contains the core REPL logic, including the main loop (`REPL.java`) and the command evaluator (`ReplEvaluator.java`).
*   `repl.commands`: Defines the `Command` interface and its various implementations.
    *   `repl.commands.builtin`: Contains the implementations of the built-in commands.
*   `repl.exceptions`: Custom exceptions for handling shell-specific errors and graceful exit.
*   `repl.utils`: Utility classes for handling directory operations (`DirUtils.java`) and finding executables (`ExecutableUtils.java`).

## Getting Started

1.  **Prerequisites:**
    *   Java 25 or higher (with preview features enabled)
    *   Maven 3.x or higher

2.  **Building the project:**
    ```sh
    mvn package
    ```

3.  **Running the shell:**
    ```sh
    ./your_program.sh
    ```
    This script executes the compiled JAR file.
